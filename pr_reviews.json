The switch to Chainguard base images in the Dockerfile is a great step towards minimizing the attack surface. The Terraform changes, including upgrading the Google provider and enabling container vulnerability scanning, further harden the infrastructure. Performance enhancements like enabling Kaniko cache and increasing timeouts are also valuable. The bug fixes for filename handling are crucial for security and stability. My review includes a few suggestions to improve reproducibility of Docker builds, enhance error handling in the Go code, and correct a configuration issue in the Terraform files to ensure they align with the intended changes and best practices.","submittedAt":"2025-12-15T12:01:53Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED","commit":{"oid":"313a7a8a09d2b9015e3dd3bfd1b0a3621d123f3a"}},{"id":"PRR_kwDOQeBNYM7VTNyF","author":{"login":"gemini-code-assist"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"## Code Review\n\nThis pull request significantly enhances the project's build, deployment, and security posture by introducing `golangci-lint` for Go code quality, migrating Docker builds to more secure and minimal Chainguard base images (Go and Static) and using Kaniko for efficient Cloud Build, and updating Terraform provider versions to `~> 6.0`. It also improves error handling for resource closures in Go code by logging errors with `slog` or `log.Printf`, adds filename sanitization and timestamping logic to prevent directory traversal and handle file overwrites in image generation and file saving tools, and increases Cloud Run and load balancer timeouts to 300 seconds. Additionally, the `README.md` now includes a Cloud Build status badge, and the `terraform/registry.tf` enables vulnerability scanning for Artifact Registry. Review comments suggest enabling `gosec` and `typecheck` linters for further code quality and security, using `slog.Error` instead of `log.Printf` for consistency in `cmd/sketchnote/main.go`, and switching from the deprecated `keypress` event to `keydown` with `e.preventDefault()` for the 'Enter' key submission in `web/app.js`.","submittedAt":"2025-12-15T14:45:54Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"COMMENTED","commit":{"oid":"040cccd0324a299f8615e074b7285efabf63d45c"}}]}
