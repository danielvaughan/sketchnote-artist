Title Text: Claude Code: Your AI-Powered Business Operating System
Featured Speaker: Daron Veener. Draw a simple caricature of him presenting with a glowing "C" for Claude.
Central Metaphor: A control panel or command center for a business, with a central AI brain, and different "departments" or functions radiating out.

Details (Small Text):
- **The 6 Mechanisms:**
  - `CLAUDE.md`: System prompt, context, rules, routines.
  - Agents: Specialized AI teammates (parallel/sequential execution).
  - Skills: Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) with progressive disclosure.
  - Power Combo: Agents + Skills = consistent, best-practice output.
  - Hooks: Deterministic automation via shell scripts (e.g., SessionStart, PreToolUse, PostToolUse).
  - Custom Commands: User-triggered workflows for complex, repetitive tasks.
  - Memorable Quote: "Hooks are deterministic (100% reliable code), whereas AI is probabilistic (creative). Hooks provide the stability the system needs."
- **The 4L Principle:**
  - Low Human: Focus on strategy & creativity.
  - Low Cost: Efficient operations.
  - Low Complexity: Streamlined processes.
  - Low Tech: Accessible tools.
- **The 5 System Secrets:**
  - Company Analogy: Folders = Departments, Agents = Teammates, You = CEO.
  - 3-Screen Organization: Left (Revenue), Right (Support), Center (Command).
  - Progressive Disclosure: Small `CLAUDE.md` as a router, load docs on-demand.
  - YAML Headers: Machine-readable metadata for all files (search/filter).
  - Backup & Remote Access: 3-layer backup (Local Git, GitHub Repo, GitHub Org) and browser access.
- **From Chatbot to OS:**
  - Core Premise: Run entire business single-handedly with AI handling operations.
  - Shift from simple chatbot to a persistent system that thinks, remembers, and executes.
  - Goal: One person generating the output of a full team.
  - Memorable Quote: "The ultimate goal is to move away from using Claude as a simple 'chatbot' for occasional tasks. By structuring it with these mechanisms, it becomes a unified, persistent system that 'thinks, remembers, and executes,' allowing a single person to generate the output of a full team."
  - Actionable Advice: Structure `CLAUDE.md` as a router; define specialized Agents and combine with Skills; use Hooks for deterministic automation; organize file structure like a company; implement 3-layer backup; utilize YAML headers.
Iconography Suggestions:
- **Overall:** A control panel with blinking lights, a central CPU/brain connected to various department nodes, gears interlocking, a single person at a desk overseeing a complex system.
- **6 Mechanisms:** Stack of papers (`CLAUDE.md`), robot head (Agent), clipboard with checklist (Skill), chain links (Power Combo), clock/gear (Hooks), shortcut icon (Custom Commands).
- **4L Principle:** A minimalist diagram, a scale balancing simple icons.
- **5 System Secrets:** File folder hierarchy, three monitor screens, a magnifying glass over partial text (progressive disclosure), a YAML file icon, cloud/lock icon (backup/remote).
- **From Chatbot to OS:** A simple speech bubble transforming into a complex network diagram, a person with many arms or tasks being managed.
Mood: Innovative, empowering, efficient, strategic, futuristic.
