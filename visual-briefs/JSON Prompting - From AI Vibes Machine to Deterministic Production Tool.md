Featured Speaker: Nate B. Jones (Draw a caricature of him with a thought bubble showing JSON code transforming into an image, and a little "secret" icon next to him).
Central Metaphor: A blueprint or architectural plan (JSON) guiding a 3D printer (Nano Banana Pro) to build a precise structure (the image).
Visual Hierarchy:
Header (Big Text): JSON Prompting: From AI "Vibes Machine" to Deterministic Production Tool
Sub-Headers (Medium Text):
- JSON: The "Correctness" Engine
- Compositional Control & Visual Grammars
- AI as a Professional Tool
- Simplified Workflow: LLM as Translator
- Key Takeaways
Details (Small Text):
- **JSON: The "Correctness" Engine:**
    - Problem: Natural language = creative but unpredictable ("vibes machine").
    - Solution: JSON provides machine-readable parameters for specification.
    - Nano Banana Pro is a "renderer," not just a generator.
- **Compositional Control & Visual Grammars:**
    - "Stable Handles": Assigns specific IDs to image elements for scoped mutation.
    - Visual Grammars: JSON schema describes entities/relationships for Photos, Diagrams, UIs.
- **AI as a Professional Tool:**
    - Reproducibility: Generate identical layouts repeatedly.
    - Diff-ability: Compare prompt versions to see exact code changes.
    - Governance: Embed rules (e.g., accessibility standards) into schema.
- **Simplified Workflow: LLM as Translator:**
    - Human describes in English -> LLM translates to JSON (using a special prompt) -> Human reviews JSON (pseudo-code) -> Nano Banana Pro renders image.
    - No coding knowledge needed for the user.
- **Key Takeaways:**
    - Learn to read pseudo-code (JSON structure).
    - Use LLMs as translators to bridge natural language and JSON.
    - JSON adds value across domains by ensuring structural correctness.
Iconography Suggestions:
- **General:** A magnifying glass, a blueprint, a circuit board, a robot arm.
- **"Vibes Machine" vs. Deterministic:** A wavy, abstract shape transforming into a sharp, geometric shape; a "magic wand" crossing out and a "ruler/compass" appearing.
- **JSON:** Curly braces `{}` with text inside, a data table, a logic gate.
- **Correctness Engine:** A green checkmark, a gear, a target.
- **Compositional Control:** Building blocks, puzzle pieces fitting together, a camera lens with focus lines.
- **Professional Tool:** A briefcase, a shield (governance), a magnifying glass comparing two identical images (diff-ability), a printer icon.
- **Workflow:** Speech bubble -> LLM icon -> JSON code block -> Image icon.
- **LLM as Translator:** A brain icon connected to a JSON icon with an arrow.
- **Pseudo-code:** A book with code lines, a person reading a blueprint.
