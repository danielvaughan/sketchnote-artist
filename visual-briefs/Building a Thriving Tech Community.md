*   Prioritize "attitude over technical skill."
Iconography Suggestions: Interlocking puzzle pieces or gears, a diverse group of stick figures holding hands, a heart icon for passion/attitude.

Listen, Execute & Iterate
Details (Small Text):
*   Understand your audience: Listen 70% of the time. Use surveys, focus groups, coffee chats.
*   Don't overplan: "If your first version isn't embarrassing, you launched too late."
*   Launch fast, learn from failures, and improve quickly.
*   Collaborate with other groups/partnerships to expand reach and diversity.
Iconography Suggestions: An ear with sound waves, a speech bubble with a question mark, a fast-moving rocket or a basic prototype, an arrow in a loop, two hands shaking for partnership.

Embrace Lifelong Learning & Networking

*   Adopt a lifelong learning mindset to succeed.
*   Build your network early (as students). Use the LinkedIn tip: send context message immediately.
*   Most jobs come through connections, not blind applications.
