Details (Small Text):
*   **Season 1:**
    *   Buck Rogers: 20th-century instincts, charming "fish out of water."
    *   Wilma Deering: Strong, no-nonsense partner.
    *   Twiki: Ambuquad robot, show mascot, comic relief (voiced by Mel Blanc).
    *   Villains: Campy Princess Ardala & Kane.
    *   Tone: Lighthearted, colorful, action-packed "space disco."
*   **Production Origins:**
    *   Based on 1928 novella/comic strips.
    *   Prompted by *Star Wars* success (1977).
    *   Pilot released theatrically, led to series.
    *   Reused props/sets from *Battlestar Galactica* (Viper joystick, shuttle designs).
*   **Behind-the-Scenes Conflicts:**
    *   Gil Gerard vs. Writers: Gerard wanted serious Buck, network wanted lighthearted.
    *   Wardrobe: Restrictive spandex, weight issues.
*   **Season 2: "A Double Homicide":**
    *   Massive retooling, new showrunners.
    *   Concept Change: "The Searcher" to find lost human colonies (like *Star Trek*).
    *   Character Assassination: Dr. Huer & Theopolis removed; Wilma demoted to "flight attendant"; Twiki's voice briefly changed.
    *   New Tone: Tried to be serious/intellectual, became boring, poorly paced.
    *   Only positive: Hawk (bird-man alien), but underutilized.
    *   Quote: "They tried to fix what wasn't broken."
*   **Legacy:**
    *   Season 1: "Cheesy," "guilty pleasure," fun.
    *   Season 2: "Inferior," dull failure.
    *   Cultural Time Capsule: Disco era influence (music, lighting, fashion).
    *   Influenced pop culture (*South Park*, *Duck Dodgers*).
    *   Works best as lighthearted space opera (Season 1).
Iconography Suggestions:
*   **Overall:** A rocket ship splitting into two paths (one vibrant, one dull/broken).
*   **Buck Rogers:** Astronaut helmet, 70s-style hair, a bewildered expression.
*   **Wilma Deering:** Laser pistol, a determined stance.
*   **Twiki:** Small robot with a distinctive head, maybe a speech bubble "Bidi-bidi-bidi."
*   **Season 1:** Disco ball, vibrant colors, "1970s" text.
*   **Star Wars Effect:** A star field with a prominent "STAR WARS" logo.
*   **Budget Saving:** A dollar sign over a *Battlestar Galactica* ship model.
*   **Conflicts:** Two opposing figures in an argument bubble.
*   **Season 2:** A tombstone or broken showreel, a ship labeled "The Searcher."
*   **Demotion:** A "DEMOTED" stamp on a character's uniform.
*   **Legacy:** A classic film reel, a "time capsule" opening.
Mood: Nostalgic, critical, humorous (for the Season 1 parts), disappointed (for Season 2 parts).
