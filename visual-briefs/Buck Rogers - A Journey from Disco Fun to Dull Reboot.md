Details (Small Text):
- **Season 1: Campy Cosmic Disco:**
    - Late 70s aesthetic: bright lighting, space discos, roller skates.
    - Pulp action-adventure with clear villains (Draconians).
    - Buck: Charming, happy-go-lucky hero.
    - Wilma: High-ranking Colonel, co-lead, strong fighter.
    - Twiki: Ambuquad droid, comic relief ("bidi-bidi-bidi").
    - Costumes: Incredibly tight spandex, "fashion-forward" but impractical.
- **Season 2: The Serious (and Failed) Star Trek Pivot:**
    - Drastic tonal shift, cost-cutting, more serious.
    - Setting moved to starship *The Searcher* (finding lost colonies).
    - Wilma downgraded to "glorified flight attendant."
    - New characters: Admiral Asimov, Dr. Goodfellow, obnoxious robot Crichton.
    - Hawk: Positive addition, but underutilized.
    - Slow pacing, serious dialogue, dull storylines.
    - Outcome: Ratings plummeted, canceled.
- **Production & The "Television Lasagna":**
    - Heavy reuse of props, models, sound effects from *Battlestar Galactica*.
    - Ship in S2 (*The Searcher*) was a repainted S1 model.
    - Solid visual effects for the time (improved in S2).
    - Friction between Gil Gerard and producers over tone.
    - Quote: "television lasagna"
- **Legacy: A Cheesy, Nostalgic Blast:**
    - "Guilty pleasure," fun, nostalgic artifact.
    - Great chemistry between Gil Gerard and Erin Gray.
    - Best remembered for lighthearted S1.
    - Quote: "bidi-bidi-bidi"
    - Quote: "impossible to take seriously" (S2)
Iconography Suggestions:
- **General:** Star Wars-esque spaceship, disco ball, 70s-style ray gun, a calendar or clock showing 1987 frozen and then 2491.
- **Season 1:** Disco lights, roller skates, a "pulp novel" cover, a princess crown (Ardala), Twiki's head with "bidi-bidi-bidi" speech bubble, spandex fabric texture.
- **Season 2:** A broken starship, a "Star Trek" delta shield icon (crossed out), a scientist in a lab coat, a bird-man (Hawk), a "canceled" stamp.
- **Production:** A film reel, a set of reused props/models (e.g., a *Battlestar Galactica* Viper next to a *Buck Rogers* Thunderfighter with an arrow indicating reuse), a block of cheese with layers.
- **Legacy:** A trophy or medal (for "guilty pleasure"), two people shaking hands or smiling (Gil Gerard & Erin Gray chemistry), a thought bubble with "nostalgia."
Mood: Playful, nostalgic, slightly critical but ultimately affectionate.
