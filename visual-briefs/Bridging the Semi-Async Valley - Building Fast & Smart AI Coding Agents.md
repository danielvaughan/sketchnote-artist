Details (Small Text):
- **The Speed-Smart Conundrum:**
    - Problem: Fast models lack intelligence, smart models are too slow ("airplane Wi-Fi").
    - Solution: MoE architecture for 4x faster token generation, slightly below frontier models in raw intelligence.
- **RL Rollouts: The Training Engine:**
    - Workflow: Agent decides tools (Read, Edit, Search, Terminal) based on query.
    - Training: Simulations ("rollouts") where model solves problems with tool sequences.
    - Scoring: Outputs scored against internal benchmarks to update model parameters.
- **Infra is King: Engineering for AI Success:**
    - Training Speed: Custom kernels (MXFP8) for 3.5x speedup on Blackwell.
    - Process Efficiency: Ray for load balancing, preventing idle GPU time.
    - Environment: Matching training/production via Cloud Agents infra for effective RL.
- **Composer's Learned Superpowers:**
    - Parallelism: Learned to call tools concurrently (e.g., reading 10 files at once).
    - Semantic Search: Became a "power user" of specific embedding models (23.5% improvement).
    - Prudence: Searches/reads *before* editing to reduce errors.
- **Key Lessons for AI Development:**
    - RL excels in specialized domains with good data/compute.
    - Infrastructure engineering is critical for AI research.
    - Avoid the "Semi-Async Valley of Death" – push for speed to stay in flow.
    - Use AI tools to accelerate AI R&D.
Iconography Suggestions:
- **General Concepts:** Stopwatch, lightbulb (intelligence), gears (engineering/process), a bridge connecting two islands.
- **Speed/Smart:** A cheetah (fast), a human brain (smart), a high-performance race car or engine.
- **RL Rollouts:** Dice, a flow chart with decision points, a target with arrows hitting it.
- **Infrastructure:** Server racks, interconnected wires, a wrench, a blueprint, a construction site.
- **Learned Behaviors:** Multiple hands working simultaneously (parallelism), a magnifying glass over lines of code (semantic search), a safety helmet or a 'stop' sign (prudence).
- **Conclusions:** A road sign, a compass, a magnifying glass on a document, building blocks.
Mood: Energetic, innovative, problem-solving, focused, forward-looking.
