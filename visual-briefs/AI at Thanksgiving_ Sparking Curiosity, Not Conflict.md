Details (Small Text):
*   Validate Moral Foundations:
    *   Cheating/Fairness: AI like steroids (banned in competition, useful for training).
    *   Fake Art/Authenticity: AI like a camera (new medium, human art retains value).
    *   Job Loss/Care: AI accessible to all (leverage for careers, not just wealthy).
*   Augmentation Over Automation:
    *   "Robot doctor" fear: Reframe AI as an "Iron Man suit" for doctors, enhancing judgment.
*   Abundance Over Scarcity:
    *   Environmental concerns: Contextualize AI usage vs. other industries (golf courses, household leaks).
    *   Education: AI creates abundance of personalized tutoring.
*   Embrace the "Beta Tester" Phase:
    *   Current glitches: AI is like the internet in 1994, a rapidly evolving prototype.
*   Goal: Curiosity, Not Conversion:
    *   Don't need to convince AI is perfect; aim to open minds to curiosity.
    *   Suggest practical AI uses: trivia games, thank-you notes, menu planning.
    *   Acknowledge media misunderstanding fuels fear.
