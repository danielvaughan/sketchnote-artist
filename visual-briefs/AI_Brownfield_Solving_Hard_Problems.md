Featured Speaker: Dex Horthy (Draw a simple caricature with a thought bubble above his head containing a small AI brain icon).
Central Metaphor: A journey through a complex, overgrown forest (brownfield) with a clear map and compass (context engineering & RPI workflow) to reach a well-built structure (solved problem).
Visual Hierarchy:
Header (Big Text): Solve Hard Problems in Complex Codebases: Context, Workflow, & Mental Alignment with AI.
Sub-Headers (Medium Text):
- The Brownfield Challenge: AI's "Slop" Problem
- Advanced Context Engineering: Navigating the LLM Landscape
- The RPI Workflow: A Structured Approach to Problem Solving
- Human Leverage: Mental Alignment & Intent Verification
Details (Small Text):
- **The Brownfield Challenge:**
    - AI struggles with large, existing, complex legacy systems.
    - Generates "slop" (technical debt) without proper guidance.
    - Goal: Solve complex problems without slop, maintaining human mental alignment.
- **Advanced Context Engineering:**
    - LLMs are stateless; context is key.
    - "Dumb Zone": Reasoning degrades as context window fills.
    - "Smart Zone": Keep context < 40% of max.
    - Intentional Compaction: Summarize `progress.md`, restart conversation to reset "trajectory."
    - Sub-Agents: Use to filter and summarize specific modules, preventing main context pollution.
- **The RPI Workflow:**
    - **Research (Compression of Truth):** AI finds/summarizes system function. Output: high-fidelity research doc.
    - **Plan (Compression of Intent):** Outline exact changes (files, lines, snippets). **Crucial Human Review.**
    - **Implement (Reliable Execution):** AI writes code based on detailed, validated plan. Low context needed.
- **Human Leverage:**
    - Maintain "Mental Alignment" by reviewing Research & Plan, not just code.
    - "Don't Outsource the Thinking": AI amplifies, doesn't replace.
    - Humans apply intelligence at high-leverage points.
    - Verify intent before execution (true "Spec-Driven Development").
Iconography Suggestions:
- **Brownfield:** Overgrown, tangled wires/code, a crumbling building, a messy desk.
- **AI Slop:** A messy pile of code, a broken gear, a "No" symbol over a clean code snippet.
- **Context Window:** A sliding window, a scroll bar, a brain with a limited capacity.
- **Smart Zone/Dumb Zone:** A green zone/red zone on a meter, a lightbulb/dark cloud.
- **Intentional Compaction:** A document being compressed, a reset button, a clean slate.
- **Sub-Agents:** Small helper robots with magnifying glasses, a filter icon.
- **Research:** A magnifying glass, open books, a map.
- **Plan:** A blueprint, a checklist, a detailed drawing.
- **Implement:** A robotic arm coding, a hammer and nails, a finished product.
- **Human Review/Mental Alignment:** Two hands shaking, a brain connected to a blueprint, a person thoughtfully looking at a plan.
- **Don't Outsource Thinking:** A human brain with gears, a lightbulb over a human head, a "do not feed the robots" sign (but for thinking).
Mood: Informative, empowering, structured, clear.
