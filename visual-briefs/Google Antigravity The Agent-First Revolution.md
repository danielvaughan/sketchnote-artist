Title Text: Google Antigravity: The Agent-First Revolution
Featured Speaker: Kevin Hou, Head of Product Engineering at Google DeepMind (Draw a simple caricature, perhaps with a headset, gesturing towards a futuristic screen. Include his title in a small banner.)
Central Metaphor: A control tower or command center with multiple "agents" (represented as small robots or icons) working on different screens/tasks, all coordinated from a central hub. Or, a complex, interconnected system where AI is the "brain."

Sub-Headers (Medium Text):
- The Agent-First Paradigm Shift
- Three Integrated Work Surfaces
- Dynamic Artifacts for Oversight
- Multimodal Design & Verification
- The Research-Product Flywheel
Details (Small Text):
- **The Agent-First Paradigm Shift:**
    - Moves beyond coding assistants (autocomplete, chat).
    - Autonomous agents manage complex, long-running tasks.
    - Powered by Gemini 3 model's reasoning and multimodal capabilities.
- **Three Integrated Work Surfaces:**
    - **Agent Manager:** Central hub, high-level view, Inbox for parallel agents & permissions.
    - **AI Editor:** VS Code fork with agent sidebar (Command+E to switch).
    - **Agent-Controlled Browser:** Autonomous control (click, scroll, type, JS), screen recordings for verification.
- **Dynamic Artifacts for Oversight:**
    - Artifacts: Dynamic info (plans, diagrams, tasks, video walkthroughs).
    - Agent decides if, what, and who needs to see artifacts.
    - User feedback directly on artifacts (highlight, draw).
- **Multimodal Design & Verification:**
    - Leveraging Gemini's image generation and understanding.
    - Generate UI mockups, iterate by commenting on images (like Figma).
    - Use screenshots/recordings for code verification.
- **The Research-Product Flywheel:**
    - "Be Your Own Biggest User": Team built product using product.
    - Reciprocal improvement: Product finds model gaps, research fixes model; Research finds tooling inadequate, product improves IDE.
Memorable Quotes:
- "unapologetically Agent-First"
- "defy gravity"
- "Be Your Own Biggest User"
Iconography Suggestions:
- Header: A robot hand writing code on a screen, or an AI brain with gears.
- Agent-First: A small robot figure leading a team of developers.
- Agent Manager: A dashboard with multiple task icons.
- AI Editor: VS Code logo or a code editor screen.
- Agent-Controlled Browser: A Chrome browser icon with a robot hand clicking, small video play button for screen recordings.
- Artifacts: Scroll with diagrams, video play button, task list with checkmarks. A speech bubble for comments.
- Multimodal: Icons for text, image, video. A UI mockup being drawn from a text prompt.
- Flywheel: A gear mechanism or a circular arrow diagram showing "Research" and "Product" feeding into each other.
- Kevin Hou: A thought bubble with "unapologetically Agent-First" nearby.
- Quotes: Distinct speech bubbles with the verbatim quotes.
Mood: Visionary, transformative, efficient, interconnected, futuristic.
