Title Text: The Future of AI: Beyond Scaling & Towards Super-Intelligent Learning
Featured Speaker: Ilya Sutskever (Draw a simple, thoughtful caricature with a lightbulb above his head) & Nate B. Jones (Write name in a smaller, analytical font next to a microphone icon).
Central Metaphor: A journey from a blunt instrument to a precision tool, or a transformation from a "grinder" student to a "genius" learner. Perhaps a broken ladder (scaling) and a new path being forged.

Details (Small Text):
*   **The Brittleness Problem:**
    *   AI models have trillions of parameters but are unreliable.
    *   "Vibe Coding" loop: fixing one bug, reintroducing another.
    *   Pre-training is a "blunt instrument," post-training optimizes benchmarks, not robust reasoning.
    *   Models perform on "evaluation manifold," fail off-script (e.g., "Christmas Tree" logic).
*   **The Generalization Gap:**
    *   Models generalize "dramatically worse than humans."
    *   "Grinder" LLMs vs. "Genius" human learners (10,000 hrs vs. 100 hrs).
    *   Need machine learning for biological sample efficiency (human learns to drive in ~10 hrs, AI needs billions of miles).
    *   Sharply opposed to Google's continuous scaling stance.
*   **Emotion as a Value Function:**
    *   Emotions are a highly efficient, forward-looking "value function" (gut check).
    *   RL is backward-looking (rewards after maze), emotions are forward-looking (fear before dark alley).
    *   Bridging this gap is essential for truly intelligent agents.
*   **Beyond Scaling:**
    *   "Scaling era" is over: web-scale data is finite.
    *   Entering a "Research Era": requires scientific breakthrough and "research taste," not just brute force.
    *   Contrasts with other labs betting on synthetic data for scaling.
*   **Redefining AGI:**
    *   AGI is about *learning capability* (super-intelligent human), not a static job list.
    *   SSI's goal: "Super-Intelligent Learner" that learns and specializes rapidly.
    *   Safety via incremental deployment: deploy less capable systems, observe, learn risks.
Iconography Suggestions:
*   **Overall:** A broken ladder or bridge with new, uncertain path ahead; a large, complex, but fragile machine; a simple, elegant brain or learning symbol.
*   **Brittleness:** Jigsaw puzzle pieces that don't quite fit; a robot trying to fix a bug in a loop (infinity symbol); a cracked shield.
*   **Generalization Gap:** A human brain next to a massive, clunky computer; a speedometer with "human" at 10 hours and "AI" at billions of miles; a student with a huge pile of books vs. a student with a few key concepts.
*   **Emotion/Value Function:** A heart with a compass inside; a traffic light (forward-looking decision); an "undo" arrow with a forward-looking "predict" arrow.
*   **End of Scaling:** A diminishing stack of coins/data; a "dead end" sign on a road labeled "scaling"; a magnifying glass over a single, profound idea.
*   **Redefining AGI:** A seedling growing rapidly; a question mark evolving into a learning brain; two hands building something carefully, step-by-step.
Mood: Serious, analytical, forward-looking, slightly urgent, intellectually challenging.
