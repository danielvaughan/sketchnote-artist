    - Aiming to support 2M+ daily active users and 16M+ daily transactions.
- **Community & Developers:**
    - Community is the driving force, incentivizing user buy-in.
    - Developer support: Hackathons ("Revelation"), gas fee rebates, liquidity incentives.
    - Advisory: Tokenomics and marketing assistance for startups.
- **Emerging Use Cases:**
    - DeFi: Evolving beyond yield farming to sophisticated tools.
    - Gaming (GameFi): ~40% of BNB Chain's user base.

    - Solution: CeDeFi (centralized access to decentralized finance).
    - Tooling: Web3Auth for social media logins to Web3 apps.
Iconography Suggestions:
- **Header:** A stylized bridge connecting two distinct landmasses (one labeled "Web2" with traditional icons, the other "Web3" with crypto/NFT icons). Many small figures crossing the bridge.
- **Evolution to Web3:** A timeline or progression arrow, classic entertainment icons transforming into futuristic ones (e.g., old TV to VR headset), old coin to crypto coin/NFT.
- **Multi-Chain Backbone:** A central hub with multiple chains branching out, gears interlocking, building blocks stacked high for scalability, a network diagram.
- **Community & Developers:** A group of diverse people huddling together, speech bubbles, hands shaking, a megaphone for community, a toolbox or laptop for developers, a growth chart.
- **Emerging Use Cases:** Icons representing different industries: a dollar sign for DeFi, a joystick/controller for GameFi, musical notes for Music, a sports trophy/ball for sports, a robot head for AI.
- **Bridging the Usability Gap:** A simplified padlock, a social media icon (e.g., Google, Twitter logo) leading to a crypto wallet icon, a smooth ramp or a hand extending from Web2 to Web3.
