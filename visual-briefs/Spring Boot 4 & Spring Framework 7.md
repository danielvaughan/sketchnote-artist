Title Text: Bootiful Spring Boot 4: The Future of Modern Java Development
Central Metaphor: A journey of evolution and transformation, like a caterpillar becoming a butterfly, or upgrading a car to a high-performance model.
Visual Hierarchy:
Header (Big Text): Spring Boot 4 & Spring Framework 7: Modernizing Java Development for Leaner, More Secure, and Ergonomic Applications
Sub-Headers (Medium Text):
- Embracing Modern Java: Leaner Code, Script-like Experience
- Modular Architecture: Granular Control, Focused Applications
- Functional Bean Registration: Type-Safe, Dynamic, Efficient
- Built-in Resilience & Declarative APIs: Robust and Concise Development
- Evolving Security: Towards a Passwordless Future
Details (Small Text):
- **Embracing Modern Java:**
    - Strong advocacy for Java 25: performance, robustness, syntax.
    - "Java Script": Single-file Spring Boot apps via JBang, eliminating boilerplate.
- **Modular Architecture:**
    - `spring-boot-autoconfigure` is split.
    - Granular dependencies: `spring-boot-starter-http-client` without web server.
    - Ideal for batch, AI, serverless.
- **Functional Bean Registration:**
    - New `BeanRegistrar` interface for programmatic, type-safe bean registration.
    - Avoids reflection overhead of `@Configuration` classes.
    - Lazy instantiation with Suppliers (lambdas).
- **Built-in Resilience & Declarative APIs:**
    - `@Retryable`, `@ConcurrencyLimit` for native resilience patterns.
    - Declarative HTTP Client: Define an interface, Spring generates implementation.
- **Evolving Security:**
    - Native support for One-Time Tokens (Magic Links).
    - Seamless Passkeys (WebAuthn) integration for passwordless login.
    - Simplified Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) with `GrantedAuthorities`.
    - Focus on how users authenticate, not just if.
Iconography Suggestions:
- **Header:** A sleek, modern "4" or "7" combined with a leaf/spring icon and gear/code symbols.
- **Modern Java:** A coffee cup with "25" on it, a single sheet of paper with code, a lightning bolt for speed.
- **Modular Architecture:** Lego bricks fitting together, a toolbox with specific tools, a network diagram.
- **Functional Bean Registration:** A pipeline or assembly line, a function symbol (f(x)), a flowing arrow.
- **Resilience & Declarative APIs:** A shield, a looping arrow for retry, a handshake symbol for declarative.
- **Evolving Security:** A key without a physical lock, a fingerprint or face ID icon, a magic wand for "magic links", intertwined gears for MFA.
Mood: Energetic, forward-thinking, empowering, modern.
