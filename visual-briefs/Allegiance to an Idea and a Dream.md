Sub-Headers (Medium Text):
The Moral Cost of Allegiance
Details (Small Text):
*   Patriotism requires critical thought; dissent can be as patriotic as military service.
*   The worst part of war is killing another human for defending their home.
*   Two honorable choices: fight if you believe, go to jail if you believe it's immoral.
Iconography Suggestions: A soldier contemplating with a question mark, scales of justice, a broken or tattered flag, a prison bar icon.

Sub-Headers (Medium Text):
Redefining "Home" and Community
Details (Small Text):
*   Disillusionment with national political polarization.
*   CouchSurfing as a global network of trust, connecting people across past conflicts (e.g., Vietnam veterans and Vietnamese youth).
*   "Home is not a specific nation, but a feeling of safety, love, and community where people 'have your back.'"
Iconography Suggestions: A globe with intertwined hands, a house icon transforming into a group of people, a couch for CouchSurfing, a heart with arrows pointing inwards.

Sub-Headers (Medium Text):
Universal Roots of Liberty
Details (Small Text):
*   **Pledge of Allegiance:** Originally for citizens of *any* republic, focused on principles of liberty and justice (no "United States of America" or "Under God").
*   **Statue of Liberty:** A gift celebrating "Liberty Enlightening the World" against tyranny, not exclusive to the US.
*   Core values of democracy and liberty are universal ideas.
Iconography Suggestions: A historical document/scroll unfurling, the Statue of Liberty with a globe, a universal symbol of freedom (e.g., a bird breaking chains), an open book of principles.

Sub-Headers (Medium Text):
A New Pledge for Humanity
Details (Small Text):
*   Urges tearing down physical and political walls.
*   Embrace universal human support.
*   Revised pledge: "I pledge allegiance to the **idea** that all people have an equal right to liberty and justice, and to the **dream** that government of the people, by the people, and for the people shall not perish from this earth."
Iconography Suggestions: A hand over a heart pointing to a globe, a broken wall, an open hand reaching out, a dove with an olive branch.

Memorable Quotes:
*   "The worst part of war is not dying, but looking through a gun sight at another human being—someone’s father or son—and killing them for defending their home."
*   "Home is not a specific nation, but a feeling of safety, love, and community where people 'have your back.'"
*   "I pledge allegiance to the **idea** that all people have an equal right to liberty and justice, and to the **dream** that government of the people, by the people, and for the people shall not perish from this earth."
