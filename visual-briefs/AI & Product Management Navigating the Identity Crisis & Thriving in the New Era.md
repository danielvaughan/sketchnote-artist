Title Text: AI & Product Management: Navigating the Identity Crisis & Thriving in the New Era
Featured Speaker: Speaker (Draw a person holding a thought bubble with a question mark, representing the identity crisis. Write "Speaker" in a simple, professional font.)
Central Metaphor: A ship navigating stormy waters (the "identity crisis") towards a lighthouse (strategic recommendations) or a transforming chrysalis (PM evolution).

Details (Small Text):
*   **The Crisis Unfolds:**
    *   AI automates PRD generation & information sharing, core PM tasks.
    *   PMs struggle with retaining thoughtfulness + speed.
*   **Challenges of Building AI Products:**
    *   AI products are probabilistic, not deterministic.
    *   Clash with executive demands for strict roadmaps/deadlines.
    *   Engineers can't guarantee timelines for probabilistic tech.
*   **PM Role Evolution:**
    *   "Glue" role eroded by AI information sharing.
    *   Scope creep: PMs now expected to prototype, code (via AI tools), design UX.
    *   Blurring lines: PM, Engineer, Designer.
*   **Path Forward: Mastering LLMs & Strategic Impact:**
    *   Achieve technical fluency in LLMs (schema validation, context windows, agents vs. tools).
    *   Crucial for credible engineering conversations.
    *   Build products that matter, avoid "AI washing."
*   **The Human Edge: Intuition & Alignment Remain Key:**
    *   Protect product intuition; never delegate decision-making to AI.
    *   AI is an assistant for mundane tasks (summaries, data checks).
    *   Focus on human alignment (Engineering & Leadership) – persuasion, managing expectations, clarity.
Iconography Suggestions:
*   **Overall:** A crumbling mask or identity badge; a gear transforming into a brain; a compass pointing towards a guiding star.
*   **Crisis/Disruption:** A broken bridge or a "falling apart" flowchart; a robot taking notes for a human.
*   **Probabilistic vs. Deterministic:** Two scales (one balanced, one wildly uneven); a clear blueprint vs. a fuzzy, evolving cloud.
*   **Scope Creep:** An expanding circle or a multi-tool symbol; blurred lines between job titles.
*   **Technical Fluency:** A book or diploma with "LLM" on it; a circuit board or code snippet.
*   **Product Intuition:** A lightbulb over a human brain/heart; a magnifying glass on a "gut" feeling.
*   **Human Alignment:** Two gears meshing perfectly; hands shaking or a bridge connecting two cliffs; a conductor leading an orchestra.
Mood: Reflective, analytical, urgent, hopeful, empowering.
