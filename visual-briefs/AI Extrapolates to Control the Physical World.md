Title Text: Antigravity AI: Mastering the Physical World
Featured Speaker: Sarah Bechtle, Research Scientist at Google DeepMind (Draw a simple caricature of Sarah explaining, perhaps with a thought bubble about AI.)
Central Metaphor: A complex machine being brought to life by AI, or AI as the central engineer/solver of a mechanical puzzle.

- AI for Any Machine
Details (Small Text):
- **The Cartpole Challenge:**
    - Goal: Control motorized cart to balance pendulum upright.
    - Classic control problem; previous AIs failed this specific setup.
    - Antigravity solved it surprisingly fast.
- **Human-Guided AI Code Generation:**
    - Prompted AI with device description (measurements, actions, communication).
    - AI generated Python controller code in minutes.
    - Human review before implementation (human-in-the-loop).
- **Multimodal Debugging & Refinement:**
    - Initial attempt failed stabilization.
    - Fed AI visual plots of system dynamics/behavior.
    - AI analyzed data, identified "overshooting," rewrote code (increased damping/PID gains).
    - Emphasizes extrapolation from general knowledge, not memorization.
- **AI for Any Machine:**
    - Two to three iterations for a functional controller.
    - Capable of acting in the physical world.
    - Applicable to any machine with command/sensor interfaces.
Iconography Suggestions:
- Header: A lightbulb over a gear.
- Cartpole: A simple drawing of a cart with an inverted pendulum.
- AI: A stylized brain or circuit board with "Antigravity" text.
- Code Generation: Python code snippets on a screen.
- Human-in-the-loop: A human hand pointing at a screen with code.
- Debugging: A magnifying glass over a graph/plot, or a wrench.
- Extrapolation: A bridge connecting general knowledge to a specific problem.
- Multimodal: Icons for text, code, and a graph/chart.
- Real-world application: Various simple machine outlines (e.g., a robot arm, a factory floor).
- Sarah Bechtle: A scientist with a lab coat, pointing at a screen.
Mood: Innovative, exciting, precise, forward-thinking.
