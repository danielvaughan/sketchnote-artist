- **From Onyx Night to Opalite Sky: The Emotional Journey**

    - "Opalite sky" symbolizes iridescence, hope, new beginnings, clarity.
    - Transition from heartbreak to optimism.
- **Reflections & Cycles: Visualizing Emotional Patterns**
    - Surreal, retro visuals (Busby Berkeley, Esther Williams style).
    - Kaleidoscopic effects, mirroring, visual repetition.
    - Reinforces lyrical themes of reflection and cyclical nature of relationships.
    - "seen it before, they'll see it again."
- **Radical Self-Reliance: Cultivating Inner Sunshine**
    - "You had to make your your own sunshine."
    - Cannot rely on a partner for happiness; must be cultivated internally.
    - Leaving the "table" where she was "starving" for past relationship.
- **Acceptance & Liberation: Embracing Impermanence**
    - "Life is a song, it ends when it ends."
    - "It's alright" – accepting the past and its pain.
    - Pain was a "temporary speed bump."
    - Finding freedom after failure in love.
