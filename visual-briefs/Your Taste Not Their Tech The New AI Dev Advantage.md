Featured Speaker: Brian Casel (Draw a simple caricature with a thought bubble showing code or design elements.)
Central Metaphor: A chef perfecting a recipe with ingredients (AI models), emphasizing skill and taste in crafting the final product.
Visual Hierarchy:
Header (Big Text): Your Taste, Not Their Tech: The New AI Dev Advantage
Sub-Headers (Medium Text):
*   **Converging Capabilities: Models are leveling up**
*   **Opus vs. Gemini: Speed vs. Polish**
*   **The Blueprint Matters: Spec-Driven Development**
*   **User Skill is King: Context & Prompting**
Details (Small Text):
*   **Converging Capabilities: Models are leveling up**
    *   Frontier AI models are becoming more similar in overall functionality.
    *   "Frontier models are converging."
    *   Gap between models is becoming less relevant than user skill.
*   **Opus vs. Gemini: Speed vs. Polish**
    *   Claude Opus 4.5: Slower, but high-quality initial design and code, better polish.
    *   Google Gemini 3: Blistering fast, but prone to initial errors, requires more debugging.
    *   Gemini's transparency: Admitted to hallucinating code when confronted with an error.
*   **The Blueprint Matters: Spec-Driven Development**
    *   Essential for fully gauging AI capabilities.
    *   Provide detailed "plan" folders and product overviews.
    *   Crucial for directing AI output effectively.
*   **User Skill is King: Context & Prompting**
    *   "The builder's ability to create detailed specs and direct the AI matters more than whether they use Gemini or Claude."
    *   Using "Design Skill" documents significantly improves aesthetic output.
    *   Prompt engineering and context loading are paramount.
    *   The "Plan Mode" workflow (AI asking clarifying questions) is a powerful, underrated feature.
    *   "The 'unfair advantage' is no longer access to a specific model, but rather: Product Instincts, Architectural Decisions, Taste."
Iconography Suggestions:
*   **Convergence:** Two converging arrows, gears meshing, a graph with lines meeting, two identical looking robots.
*   **Opus:** A polished diamond, a detailed blueprint, a slow-moving but sturdy tortoise, a perfectly crafted dish.
*   **Gemini:** A lightning bolt, a fast-moving but slightly wobbly hare, a broken piece of code (bug), a quickly made but slightly messy meal.
*   **Spec-Driven Dev:** A detailed map, a construction blueprint, a recipe book, a meticulously written plan.
*   **User Skill:** A conductor's baton, a chef's hat, a magnifying glass on code, a brain icon, hands crafting something.
*   **Unfair Advantage:** A crown, a key, a secret weapon, a unique ingredient.
*   **Product Instincts:** A lightbulb, a thought bubble with a product mock-up, a nose sniffing.
*   **Architectural Decisions:** Building blocks, a house frame, a sturdy bridge.
*   **Taste:** A palette with colors, a chef tasting food, a "thumbs up" icon, a discerning eye.
Mood: Informative, Strategic, Empowering.
