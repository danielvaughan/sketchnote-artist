Featured Speaker: Dex Horthy. Draw a simple caricature of a focused individual, perhaps with a thought bubble containing a tiny LLM.
Central Metaphor: A control panel or dashboard with dials and gauges representing context window management.

Details (Small Text):
- **The "Slop" & The "Dumb Zone":**
    - AI struggles with brownfield projects, creating churn and rework.
    - LLMs are stateless; performance degrades significantly above ~40% context window usage.
    - "The dumb zone is around 40% context window utilization."
- **Intentional Compaction & Sub-Agents:**
    - Aggressively manage what enters the context window.
    - Sub-agents fork context, investigate, and return only concise summaries to the parent agent.
- **The RPI Workflow: Research, Plan, Implement:**
    - **Research:** Understand system (without code), map dependencies. Output: Compressed "Research Markdown" (Truth).
    - **Plan:** Outline exact changes (filenames, line numbers, verification). **Crucial Human Review.** Output: Compressed "Planning Markdown" (Intent).
    - **Implement:** Execute the validated plan with AI, keeping context low.
    - "Correcting a bad plan is infinitely cheaper than debugging bad code later."
- **Human in the Loop: High-Leverage Thinking:**
    - AI is for leverage, not outsourcing thought.
    - Focus human effort on reviewing research and plans.
    - "Don't outsource thinking."
    - Mental alignment: easier to review a plan than thousands of lines of generated code.
Iconography Suggestions:
- For "Slop/Dumb Zone": A crowded, overflowing box or bucket with a "DANGER" sign; a gauge showing "40% capacity" in red.
- For "Intentional Compaction": A filter funnel; a hand compressing a block.
- For "Sub-Agents": Smaller gears branching off a main gear; tiny robots reporting back to a larger robot.
- For "RPI Workflow": A three-stage pipeline or assembly line.
- For "Research": A magnifying glass over a blueprint; a stack of organized documents.
- For "Plan": A checklist; a detailed map; a drawing of a brain.
- For "Implement": A wrench and screwdriver; a conveyor belt moving code blocks.
- For "Human in the Loop": A human figure pointing at a diagram; a "brain" icon at a control panel.
Mood: Focused, analytical, structured, empowering.
