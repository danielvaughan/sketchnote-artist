Details (Small Text):
*   **The Fairytale Beginning:**
    *   Opens at a massive, luxurious estate (Oheka Castle).
    *   Whirlwind, high-society romance.
    *   Ballroom dancing, dining under chandeliers, riding white horses, carving names ("Sean + Taylor").
    *   *Quote (from lyrics):* "I can make the bad guys good for a weekend."
*   **The Turning Point:**
    *   Mood shifts abruptly during a picnic scene.
    *   Swift notices her lover checking his phone and texting someone else.
    *   Her expression changes from adoration to intense jealousy and suspicion.
*   **The Descent into Madness:**
    *   Swift transforms into the caricature of the "crazy ex-girlfriend" the tabloids portrayed.
    *   Acts of destruction: drops phone in fountain, cuts holes in shirts, sets clothes on fire, throws vases.
    *   Violent imagery: stabbing a heart-shaped cake, slashing an oil painting.
    *   Climax: attacks his vintage AC Cobra sports car with a golf club.
*   **The Cyclical Conclusion:**
    *   The battered suitor finally escapes.
    *   A new, handsome man pulls up in a different car.
    *   Swift immediately wipes away tears, composes herself, and smiles, indicating the cycle is about to begin again.
    *   *Actionable Advice:* Critically analyze media portrayals of public figures and their narratives.
Iconography Suggestions:
*   **General:** A grand castle with visible cracks, a broken heart with a looping arrow, a theatrical mask (half smiling, half distraught).
*   **Fairytale Beginning:** A crown, two white horses, a chandelier, a tree trunk with "Sean + Taylor" carved into it, a couple ballroom dancing.
*   **Turning Point:** A broken phone, a suspicious eye, a wilting picnic basket.
*   **Descent into Madness:** A golf club breaking a car windshield, mascara tears running down a face, a flaming dress shirt, a shattered vase, a knife stuck in a cake, a torn canvas.
*   **Cyclical Conclusion:** An open mansion door with a fleeing car in the distance, a new luxurious car arriving, a woman wiping a single tear with one hand and smiling with the other.
Mood: Satirical, dramatic, elegant, slightly chaotic, with a tongue-in-cheek commentary.
