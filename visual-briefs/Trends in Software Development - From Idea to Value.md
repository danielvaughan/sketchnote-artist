Title Text: Trends in Software Development: From Idea to Value
Featured Speaker: Daniel Vaughan. Draw a simple caricature of Daniel with a thought bubble showing "Idea → Business Value!"
Central Metaphor: A winding river or pipeline. Ideas enter one end, passing through "bottlenecks" (dams, narrow points) and "accelerators" (turbines, clear channels), ultimately flowing into a large pool of "Business Value."
Visual Hierarchy:

- Phase 2: The Cloud Revolution
- The Final Bottleneck: Communication
- The Future: Human-Centric & Direct Engagement
Details (Small Text):
- The Problem: Defensive Development & Costly Infrastructure
    - Lengthened cycles, fear of breaking code.
    - Software seen as cost center, not investment.
    - Example: £1M infra cost for £30k project.
- Phase 1: Automation & Quality
    - Comprehensive automated testing.
    - Fast, frequent, painless deployments (multiple times/day).
    - Constant stream of value, not bug fixes.
- Phase 2: The Cloud Revolution
    - "Rent" infrastructure by the hour (AWS).
    - Democratizes enterprise-grade tech for pennies.
    - Example: Students replicated Australian Census for $500.
- The Final Bottleneck: Communication
    - "What to build" remains the issue.
    - Intermediaries (BAs) create barriers & delays.
    - "Game of telephone" leads to misunderstandings.
- The Future: Human-Centric & Direct Engagement
    - Developers must engage directly with end-users ("Matrix Team").
    - Technology is no longer the barrier, cultural is.
    - Economic model flipped: minimal ops costs for world-class software.
Iconography Suggestions:
- Idea/Value: A lightbulb, a flowing river leading to a treasure chest or graph.
- Problem: A broken gear, a wall, a dollar sign with a red X, a developer looking stressed.
- Automation: Robot arms, gears, conveyor belt, a "checkmark."
- Cloud: A cloud icon with servers inside, a dollar sign with an arrow pointing down, a laptop in a coffee cup.
- Communication: People talking, a broken telephone, a bridge connecting two sides, speech bubbles.
- Direct Engagement: Two people (developer & user) shaking hands, a team working together, a path clearing.
Mood: Reflective, analytical, but ultimately optimistic and empowering.
