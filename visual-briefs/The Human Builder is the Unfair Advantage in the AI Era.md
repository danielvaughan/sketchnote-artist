Featured Speaker: Brian Casel (Draw a simple caricature with a thought bubble above his head asking "Model or Builder?")
Central Metaphor: A construction site, with AI models as advanced tools and the human as the lead architect/engineer.
Visual Hierarchy:
Header (Big Text): The Human Builder is the Unfair Advantage in the AI Era
Sub-Headers (Medium Text):
- Models Are Converging
- Specs Drive Success
- Opus vs. Gemini: A Test Result
- The Builder's Essential Skills
Details (Small Text):
- Models Are Converging:
    - Gap between frontier models shrinking.
    - All becoming highly capable development tools.
- Specs Drive Success:
    - Detailed upfront planning is crucial.
    - Detailed product overview + clarifying questions = better AI output.
- Opus vs. Gemini: A Test Result:
    - Claude Opus 4.5: Slower but bug-free, better UI design (Emerald Green theme), flawless backend (search, client create, nested attributes).
    - Gemini 3: Faster but struggled, "boring" UI, mobile responsiveness issues, hallucinations (non-existent 'LayoutLogs' library), significant backend bugs (search, client create, invoice line items failed to save).
    - Opus won this specific showdown due to superior design and bug-free implementation.
- The Builder's Essential Skills:
    - Effectively direct the AI.
    - Apply product instincts and architectural taste.
    - Debug and verify AI's output.
Iconography Suggestions:
- Convergence: Two merging arrows or converging lines.
- Specs Drive Success: A blueprint or a detailed checklist.
- Claude Opus 4.5: A green gem or a stylized "C" with a checkmark.
- Gemini 3: A yellow/blue gem or a stylized "G" with a bug/cross.
- Builder's Edge: A human figure holding a wrench or directing a robot/AI. Gears turning in a brain.
- Bug: A tiny insect icon.
- Good Design: A clean, stylish house icon.
- Boring Design: A plain, blocky house icon.
Mood: Informative, slightly competitive, empowering.
