Title Text: GenAI: From Experiment to Enterprise Value & Agentic AI
Featured Speaker: David Cushman & Alan Flower. Draw simple caricatures of both, maybe with speech bubbles connecting to their key points.
Central Metaphor: A journey or evolution of a company, starting from a small lab (experimentation) transforming into a complex, interconnected factory (AI-native enterprise) with digital assistants.

Details (Small Text):
- The Shift: Experimentation to ROI
    - Past: "What are use cases?" Present: Implementation & "AI-native" re-engineering.
    - Focus on "obvious value streams" for immediate ROI proof.
- Real-World Impact: The AI Clinical Advisor
    - Healthcare example: AI assists doctors during consultations.
    - Saves ~3 mins per 20-min appointment.
    - Results in $50M annual labor savings for large providers.
    - Reduces clinician burnout, improves patient trust.
- Unexpected Hurdles in Scaling AI
    - **Infrastructure:** Moving from cloud to hybrid/edge/on-prem for cost.
    - **FinOps:** Not all use cases affordable; need smaller, fine-tuned models.
    - **Organizational Re-engineering:** Changing business operations for AI.
- Agentic AI: The Hybrid Workforce
    - Rapid rise of autonomous "digital employees."
    - HR challenge: Who is responsible? How to motivate humans?
    - Performance management: Adjudicating blame between humans & AI.
- Democratizing AI & Cultural Change
    - Tools like Copilot Studio simplify agent building ("Visual Basic of AI").
    - Accelerating adoption faster than expected.
    - Biggest hurdles are cultural & organizational change management, not technical.
    - HCLTech in "Horizon 3": Business transformation & hybrid workforce management.
Iconography Suggestions:
- Shift to ROI: A magnifying glass over a chat bubble transforming into a dollar sign or a gear. A blueprint changing into a working machine.
- AI Clinical Advisor: A doctor with a stethoscope, a clock with "3 mins saved," a stack of money, a smiling patient.
- Hurdles: Roadblocks or speed bumps labeled "Infra," "FinOps," "Org Change." Clouds, an on-premise server rack, a calculator, interconnected gears.
- Agentic AI: Robot figures working alongside human figures, a question mark over HR/IT, a pie chart (performance).
- Democratization/Cultural Change: A person easily building with blocks (Copilot Studio), a wrench tightening a loose gear, people shaking hands with robots, a "change" sign.
Mood: Informative, slightly cautionary about challenges but ultimately optimistic about AI's potential.
