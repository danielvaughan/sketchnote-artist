Title Text: The Combine Harvester: A Farmer's Pragmatic Proposal
Featured Speaker: The Wurzels (write band name in a fun, rustic font). Draw a simple caricature of a jovial, slightly mischievous farmer.
Central Metaphor: A "Farm Merger" or "Agricultural Business Deal" disguised as a romantic courtship. Perhaps a literal "marriage certificate" with land deeds on it, or a flowchart illustrating merging farm properties.
