  - Inheritance Tax (IHT): Nil rate bands frozen until 2031.
  - Agricultural/Business Property Relief: Transferable allowances between spouses from April 2026.
- **The Planner's Verdict: "Could Have Been Worse" (But Still Disappointing):**
  - Memorable Quote: "Could have been worse."
  - Broken Promises: Government adhered to the *letter* of manifesto (no earnings tax hike), but bypassed its *spirit* (taxed other income sources, fiscal drag).
  - Disappointment: Frustration over Salary Sacrifice cap, viewing it as making retirement planning harder and treating pensions as a "political football."
  - Actionable Advice: Review your ISA strategy due to cash limit; understand new tax rates on property income, dividends, and savings interest; consider the salary sacrifice cap's impact on pension planning; be aware of the "Mansion Tax" if applicable.
Iconography Suggestions:
- **Overall:** A winding road with financial landmarks (house, money bag, piggy bank), scales of justice, a calendar with marked dates.
- **Income Tax/NI:** A person pulling a cart up a steep hill (fiscal drag), tax forms, a calculator.
- **ISAs/Savings:** A piggy bank with a crack or a smaller opening, stacked coins, a magnifying glass over small print.
- **Pensions:** A golden egg (state pension), a broken chain link (salary sacrifice cap), an hourglass.
- **Property/Wealth:** A large house with a "TAX" sign, a gavel, a deed or scroll.
- **Pete Matthew's Reaction:** A person shrugging, a frustrated face, a 'broken' promise symbol.
Mood: Informative, cautious, serious, slightly concerned, but practical.
