Title Text: The Zero Bug Vision: AI-Powered Software Assurance
Youtube URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLqttdO33UM
Featured Speaker: Johann Schleier-Smith (Draw a simple caricature with a thought bubble containing "Zero Bugs")
Central Metaphor: A bridge from buggy software to a future of mathematically guaranteed, bug-free software.
Visual Hierarchy:
Header (Big Text): AI + Formal Methods = A Future of Zero Bugs
Sub-Headers (Medium Text):
- High Assurance Isn't a Myth
- The Power of Process & Proofs
- AI Changes the Economics
- Building Reliable AI Agents
Details (Small Text):
- High Assurance Isn't a Myth:
    - Zero-defect systems exist (Airbus A320, Space Shuttle, Curiosity Rover).
    - Reliability is an engineering choice.
- The Power of Process & Proofs:
    - Foundations: High-level languages, structured programming, modularity.
    - Formal Methods: Mathematically proving code correctness (Dafny demo).
    - Quote: "Reliability is an engineering choice, not an impossibility."
- AI Changes the Economics:
    - Cost of code generation drops dramatically (1000x-10000x cheaper).
    - Enables applying expensive high-assurance techniques to everyday software.
    - Quote: "Because AI generates code so cheaply... developers can afford to use the expensive, high-assurance verification processes."
    - Quote: "You do not verify the model; you verify the code the model produces."
- Building Reliable AI Agents:
    - Detailed specifications are key.
    - Use typed languages & modularity.
    - Employ adversarial testing (separate LLMs for code and critique).
    - Ask agents for explicit risk analysis.
    - Keep code units small.
Iconography Suggestions:
- Header: A magnifying glass over code, a shield, a mathematical equation (sigma, checkmark).
- High Assurance: A space shuttle, an airplane (Airbus A320), a small lock icon.
- Process & Proofs: Gears turning, a blueprint, a math symbol (e.g., proof symbol), a "GOTO" crossed out.
- AI & Economics: A robot/AI brain, a stack of money (cheap code), a balance scale with "code cost" on one side and "verification cost" on the other, tipping heavily towards verification.
- Building AI Agents: A checklist, building blocks, two robots facing each other (adversarial testing), a small, tidy code block.
Mood: Forward-looking, optimistic, precise, transformative.
