Title Text: The Future of Intelligent Pixels: From Bundles to Substrates
Featured Speaker: Unnamed Speaker (Draw a simple silhouette with a thought bubble above, representing "intelligent pixels.")
Central Metaphor: A building being deconstructed and reconstructed. The old building is a monolith, and the new structure is made of separate, modular layers.
Visual Hierarchy:
Header (Big Text): The Era of Disposable Pixels: Software Decouples into Substrate and Experience
Sub-Headers (Medium Text):
- Generative AI's Impact: Cheap, Ephemeral, Agentic
- The New Software Stack: Substrate, Agent, Pixels
- SaaS Transformation: Beyond the Monolith
- When Static UI Still Matters
- Evolving Roles for Tech Talent
Details (Small Text):
- **Generative AI's Impact:**
    - Generative UI: Full screens from text/context instantly.
    - Ephemeral UI: "Vibe coding," micro-apps for specific moments.
    - Agentic Software: Agents drive other software via APIs.
    - *Quote:* "pixels are becoming cheap, disposable, and hyper-contextual."
- **The New Software Stack:**
    - **Layer 1: The Substrate** (System of Record): Durable data, workflows, permissions. (The "moat")
    - **Layer 2: The Agentic Layer** (Intent & Planning): Interprets user intent, orchestrates actions.
    - **Layer 3: Disposable Pixels** (The Experience): Generated UI when human judgment needed.
    - *Quote:* "Software is decoupling into a stable substrate and throwaway pixels."
- **SaaS Transformation:**
    - End of the Monolith: Proprietary UIs become "reference implementations."
    - Disintermediation Risk: Users employ agents to extract data.
    - Winners: "Agent-addressable," schema-clean, composable products.
    - *Action:* Companies must decide: Substrate or Pixels?
    - *Quote:* "The economics of the latter [pixels] are collapsing toward zero."
- **When Static UI Still Matters:**
    - Deep Cognitive Mapping (e.g., trading, surgery).
    - Audit & Compliance (reproducible flows).
    - Shared Collaboration (shared frame of reference).
- **Evolving Roles for Tech Talent:**
    - **Designers:** Define "interface grammars," safety, interaction patterns.
    - **Product Managers:** Focus on "intents" and "outcome loops."
    - **Engineers:** Build stable APIs, lightweight shells for composability.
Iconography Suggestions:
- **Tipping Point:** A seesaw or a scale tipping over.
- **Interface Bundle:** A tightly wrapped gift box or a tangled ball of string.
- **Durable Substrate:** A sturdy foundation, bedrock, or a strong tree root system.
- **Generative AI:** A magic wand, a robot drawing, or a lightning bolt.
- **Ephemeral UI:** Bubbles popping, a disappearing puff of smoke, or a temporary sticky note.
- **Agentic Software:** A robot arm reaching out to control other apps.
- **Software Stack Layers:** Stacked blocks, a layered cake, or geological strata.
- **Moat:** A castle with a moat around it.
- **Monolith:** A large, solid, single block.
- **Disintermediation:** A bridge breaking or a direct line bypassing an old route.
- **Agent-addressable:** A clear pathway or a plug-and-socket icon.
- **Traditional UI:** A classic computer monitor with a fixed screen.
- **Talent Roles:** Gears turning, a lightbulb for new ideas, a magnifying glass for focus shift.
Mood: Forward-thinking, slightly disruptive, analytical, and empowering.
