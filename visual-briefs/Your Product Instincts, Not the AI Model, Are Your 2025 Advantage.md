Featured Speaker: The Creator (Draw a simple silhouette of a person at a desk with a thought bubble above their head).
Central Metaphor: A construction site where AI models are tools, and the developer is the architect/foreman.
Visual Hierarchy:
Header (Big Text): Your Product Instincts, Not the AI Model, Are Your 2025 Advantage
Sub-Headers (Medium Text):
- Model Performance: Reliability vs. Speed
- The Rise of "Plan Mode" Tooling
- The Developer's Unfair Advantage
- The Power of Spec-Driven Development
Details (Small Text):
- **Model Performance: Reliability vs. Speed**
    - Claude Opus 4.5: Slower, high-quality design, flawless backend, reliable.
    - Google Gemini 3: Faster, clean but "boring" design, prone to bugs, hallucinations, and incomplete features.
- **The Rise of "Plan Mode" Tooling**
    - Claude Code (Opus) & Cursor's Agent Mode (Gemini)
    - AI asks clarifying questions *before* coding.
    - Highly recommended for better outcomes.
    - Memorable Quote: "Plan Mode where the AI asks the user clarifying questions before writing code—a practice the creator highly recommends."
- **The Developer's Unfair Advantage**
    - Not *which* model you choose, but *how* you direct it.
    - Focus on product instincts, architectural taste, and AI direction.
    - Memorable Quote: "The real advantage for developers in 2025 is not the model they choose, but their product instincts, architectural taste, and ability to direct the AI."
- **The Power of Spec-Driven Development**
    - Quality upfront planning and clear specifications are crucial.
    - Avoid errors by defining requirements clearly from the start.
    - Memorable Quote: "Building without a clear spec leads to more errors downstream."
Iconography Suggestions:
- For Claude Opus: A steady, well-built structure (e.g., a strong brick wall).
- For Gemini 3: A fast but somewhat rickety or incomplete structure (e.g., a building with scaffolding and some missing parts).
- For "Plan Mode": A thought bubble with a question mark, or two gears interlocking.
- For "Developer's Advantage": A person holding a blueprint or directing a crane.
- For "Spec-Driven Development": A clipboard with a checklist, or a well-organized toolbox.
- Overall: Lightbulbs for ideas, a finish line with different runners for comparison.
Mood: Informative, Analytical, Forward-looking, Empowering.
