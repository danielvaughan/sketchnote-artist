Title Text: The AI Layoff Divide: Adapt or Be Obliterated
Central Metaphor: A Crossroads or Fork in the Road. One path is old, crumbling, and leads to a dead end. The other is new, challenging, but offers a path forward.

Details (Small Text):
- **The "Comfortable" Trap:**
    - White-collar roles (e.g., content marketing) seen as "comfortable" and not high-ROI.
    - First to be cut for AI investment & efficiency.
    - Rapid shift: AI agents replacing human tasks, often unnoticed.
- **Two Paths to Layoffs:**
    - **The "Girlboss" Reaction:** Blaming external factors, feeling victimized, insisting on personal worth ("amazing at what I do"). Leads to a "circle jerk" of mutual reinforcement.
    - **The Stoic Reaction:** Professional, neutral, acknowledging restructuring, seeking new opportunities, accepting "that's the way life goes sometimes."
- **Business Reality vs. Personal Feelings:**
    - Corporations answer to investors, not employees.
    - Efficiency drives decisions (e.g., geographic consolidation).
    - "Being fun to work with" doesn't protect jobs.
    - Entitlement culture: expectation of guaranteed career and lifestyle.
- **Decoupling Identity for Survival:**
    - Women often intertwine personal worth with job titles, leading to greater suffering.
    - Abandon the victim mindset.
    - Stop blaming capitalism or leadership for structural shifts.
    - Adopt an adaptive, stoic approach.
    - Focus on high-ROI skills and continuous adaptation.
Iconography Suggestions:
- **AI Disruption:** Robot arm, gears, circuit board, thought bubble with "AI," a literal "obliterated" sign or crumbling building.
- **Comfortable Trap:** Cozy armchair, coffee cup, laptop, a "comfort zone" bubble, a slowly sinking ship.
- **Two Paths:** A fork in the road, two contrasting figures (one weeping, one walking forward confidently), a LinkedIn logo with different post reactions.
- **Girlboss Reaction:** A mirror, a group hug icon, a crying emoji, a fist shaking at "the system."
- **Stoic Reaction:** A calm face, a handshake, an open door, a roadmap, a shield.
- **Business Reality:** Dollar signs, investor graph, a company structure chart, a magnifying glass on "efficiency," a city skyline (NYC being moved away from).
- **Entitlement:** A crown, a broken contract, a child throwing a tantrum, a broken ladder.
- **Decoupling Identity:** A person separating from a job title tag, a broken chain, a growing plant (adaptation), a compass, a warrior (stoicism).
