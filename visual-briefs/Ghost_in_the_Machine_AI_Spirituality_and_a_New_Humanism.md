Title Text: Ghost in the Machine: AI, Spirituality, and a New Humanism
Featured Speaker: Kenneth Cukier. Draw a simple caricature of him with a thought bubble containing "AI + Humanism".
Central Metaphor: A balanced scale with "Logos" (data, AI) on one side and "Mythos" (meaning, humanity) on the other, or a human figure at a crossroads between data and meaning.

Details (Small Text):
- **AI: Patterns Without Understanding:**
  - Parses vast data for correlations (e.g., identifying a cat by pixels).
  - Retina example: AI identifies cardiovascular risk & biological sex, exceeding human perception.
  - Memorable Quote: "AI access knowledge that exceeds human perception." (Implied from retina example)
- **The Danger of the Average:**
  - LLMs predict associations based on past data (e.g., "Queen" associates with "King").
  - Output aims for bell curve average, avoiding the "tails" (ridiculous or nonsensical answers).
  - Genius and true innovation also live in the "tails"; AI cuts this off.
  - Stunts worldview (e.g., 1923 ChatGPT wouldn't link "woman" and "lawyer").
  - Memorable Quote: "Genius and true innovation also live in the tails."
- **Humanity: Reasoning Beyond Data:**
  - Humans use mental models (frames) to understand reality (e.g., Kanizsa Triangle illusion).
  - Counterfactual reasoning: interpreting the absence of information; seeing what *is not* there.
  - AI relies entirely on the *presence* of data; cannot reason based on what is missing.
  - Memorable Quote: "Humans can see what is not there."
- **The "Harder Problem" of Life:**
  - Challenges "substrate independence" of consciousness by tech evangelists.
  - Human intelligence is inextricably linked to our biology, emotions, mortality, and physical bodies (embodiment).
  - Introduces the "harder problem of the soul": life itself is a mystery code cannot replicate (e.g., Ship of Theseus ignores the "spark" of life).
  - Memorable Quote: "The harder problem of the soul."
- **Logos vs. Mythos: Reclaiming Meaning:**
  - Logos: Logic, data, analytics, facts (the domain of AI).
  - Mythos: Timeless truths, storytelling, meaning, and spirituality (the domain of Humans).
  - Deepest human understanding: comes from the *apophatic* tradition—learning through silence, emptiness (*kenosis*), and the "cloud of unknowing," rather than data accumulation.
  - Memorable Quote: "The deepest human understanding comes from the *apophatic* tradition—learning through silence, emptiness (*kenosis*), and the 'cloud of unknowing,' rather than data accumulation."
  - Actionable Advice: Embrace AI for its utility; recognize that true understanding often happens when we push the world away and sit in silence; humans must re-center on meaning (Mythos) as AI handles data (Logos); our unique value lies in deriving meaning from absence, mortality, and the sacred.
Iconography Suggestions:
- **Overall:** A human brain with two distinct halves (one labeled AI/Logos, the other Human/Mythos), a philosophical thinking figure, a new dawn/sunset over a horizon.
- **AI Patterns:** Magnifying glass over data, a cat figure formed from pixels, an eye icon with data lines, a bell curve with the ends visually cut off.
- **Human Understanding:** A human head with a vibrant lightbulb, the Kanizsa Triangle optical illusion, a question mark, a silhouette of a person contemplating emptiness.
- **Soul/Consciousness:** A glowing heart, a 'spark' visual, a human figure surrounded by an ethereal light, a DNA helix intertwining with a spirit symbol.
- **Logos/Mythos:** An abacus or calculator for Logos; an open book, a campfire with people telling stories, or a spiritual symbol (e.g., lotus flower) for Mythos; a yin-yang symbol.
Mood: Thought-provoking, philosophical, insightful, reflective, hopeful for humanity's future.
