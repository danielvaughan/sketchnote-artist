Title Text: The Great Decoupling: From Interface Bundles to Durable Substrates
Featured Speaker: Unnamed Speaker (Draw a simple silhouette with a thought bubble above, representing "intelligent pixels.")
Central Metaphor: A building being deconstructed and reconstructed. The old building is a monolithic structure, and the new structure is made of separate, modular layers. A seesaw is tipping towards the new modular structure.

Details (Small Text):
- **The Catalyst: Generative AI & Disposable Pixels**
    - Generative UI: Models generate full screens from text.
    - Ephemeral Apps: Hyper-contextual, created for a single task, then destroyed.
    - Agentic Software: Agents call APIs to retrieve and visualize data instantly.
    - *Quote:* "pixels are becoming cheap, disposable, and hyper-contextual."
- **The New Software Architecture: 3 Layers**
    - **Layer 1: The System of Record (Durable Substrate):** Data models, permissions, compliance, workflows. (The "moat").
    - **Layer 2: The Agentic Layer (Intent & Planning):** Interprets user intent, plans and executes queries.
    - **Layer 3: The Pixel Layer (Disposable Interface):** Generated only when human judgment is needed, then thrown away.
    - *Quote:* "Software is decoupling into a stable substrate and throwaway pixels."
- **B2B SaaS: Threat & Opportunity**
    - **Threat:** Monolithic SaaS (forcing users into specific UI) risks disintermediation by agents.
    - **Opportunity:** Pivot to "Substrate as a Service" (clean APIs, good schemas, safe compliance).
    - "Slack" Model: Stable shells where ephemeral UIs populate for collaboration.
    - *Action:* Companies must decide: Substrate or Pixels?
    - *Quote:* "The economics of the latter [pixels] are collapsing toward zero."
- **Evolving Roles for Tech Talent**
    - **Designers:** Define interface grammars, constraints, and safety protocols.
    - **Product Managers:** Focus on user intents and outcomes, not just features.
    - **Engineers:** Build stable, agent-addressable interfaces and validation logic, less frontend pixel-pushing.
- **Where Traditional UI Endures**
    - High-stakes environments: Trading terminals, medical devices (spatial/muscle memory).
    - Audit & Compliance: Reproducible, identical flows.
    - Shared Collaboration: Needs a common frame of reference.
Iconography Suggestions:
- **Tipping Point:** A seesaw or a scale tipping over.
- **Interface Bundle:** A tightly wrapped gift box or a tangled ball of string.
- **Durable Substrate:** A sturdy foundation, bedrock, or strong tree roots.
- **Generative AI:** A magic wand or a lightning bolt striking.
- **Ephemeral Apps/UI:** Bubbles popping, a disappearing puff of smoke, a temporary sticky note.
- **Agentic Software:** A robot arm reaching out to control other apps or a software agent icon (e.g., a small bot).
- **Software Stack Layers:** Stacked blocks, a layered cake, or geological strata.
- **Moat:** A castle with a moat around it.
- **Monolith:** A large, solid, single block breaking apart.
- **Disintermediation:** A broken bridge or a direct line bypassing an old route.
- **Agent-addressable:** A clear pathway, a plug-and-socket icon, or a well-organized file cabinet.
- **Traditional UI:** A classic computer monitor with a fixed screen.
- **Talent Roles:** Gears turning, a lightbulb for new ideas, a magnifying glass for focus shift.
- **Decision/Action:** A diverging path or a crossroads icon.
Mood: Forward-thinking, transformative, analytical, urgent.
