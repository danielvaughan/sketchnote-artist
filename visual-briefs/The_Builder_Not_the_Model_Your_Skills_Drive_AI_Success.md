Featured Speaker: Brian Casel (Draw a simple caricature or bust)
Central Metaphor: A conductor leading an orchestra, or a builder with a blueprint.

Header (Big Text): The Builder, Not the Model: Your Skills Drive AI Success
Sub-Headers (Medium Text):
*   Model Capabilities Are Converging
*   Human Direction is the New Frontier Skill
*   Specs & Planning Prevent Project Pitfalls
*   The Speed vs. Quality Dilemma
*   AI's Evolving Self-Awareness
Details (Small Text):
*   **Model Capabilities Are Converging:**
    *   Gap between models (e.g., Google, Anthropic) is shrinking.
    *   Choice of specific model becomes less critical.
*   **Human Direction is the New Frontier Skill:**
    *   Success depends on the builder's ability to *direct* the AI.
    *   Requires strong product instincts and architectural decisions.
    *   Your "taste" and refinement skills are crucial.
*   **Specs & Planning Prevent Project Pitfalls:**
    *   Detailed, spec-driven development is paramount.
    *   Time spent on upfront planning prevents bugs and issues later.
*   **The Speed vs. Quality Dilemma:**
    *   Opus 4.5: Higher quality, fewer bugs (in this test).
    *   Gemini 3: Significantly faster, but with more initial errors.
*   **AI's Evolving Self-Awareness:**
    *   Gemini 3 explicitly admitting a "hallucination" was a unique and notable moment.
    *   Suggests a potential shift in how models handle errors.
Iconography Suggestions:
*   **Convergence:** Two converging arrows, a "bridge" between two AI icons.
*   **Human Direction:** A human figure holding a blueprint or conducting an orchestra. Gears turning with "specs" and "instincts" written on them.
*   **Specs & Planning:** A detailed blueprint, a checklist, a magnifying glass over code.
*   **Speed vs. Quality:** A tortoise and a hare, a stop/go light with "fast" and "polished."
*   **Hallucination:** A thought bubble with a question mark or a "bug" icon, maybe a small "I was wrong" speech bubble coming from a robot head.
