Featured Speaker: Johann Schleier-Smith (Temporal Technologies). Draw a simple caricature next to his name.
Central Metaphor: A bridge being built, connecting two previously separate lands: "Expensive Aerospace Reliability" and "Mass-Market Software Development." AI is the construction crew.
Visual Hierarchy:
Header (Big Text): Zero Bugs: How AI Democratizes High-Assurance Software
Sub-Headers (Medium Text):
*   Bug-Free Software is Proven
*   Process is the Path to Reliability
*   Foundations for Assurance
*   AI: The Economic Game Changer
*   Practical Steps for Today
Details (Small Text):
*   **Bug-Free Software is Proven**
    *   Aerospace examples: Airbus A320, Space Shuttle, Mars Curiosity Rover.
    *   "The core of the argument rests on the fact that **bug-free software already exists**."
    *   Reliability is a solved engineering problem, but previously expensive.
*   **Process is the Path to Reliability**
    *   Achieved through detailed planning, requirements, design, integration, and certification.
    *   Emphasis on "zero defect tolerance" mindset.
*   **Foundations for Assurance**
    *   Computer Science advancements: Abstraction, Modularity, Structured Programming.
    *   Formal Verification: Languages like Dafny (mathematical proofs inline with code).
    *   Verification tools (SMT solvers) are faster and commercially relevant.
*   **AI: The Economic Game Changer**
    *   High Assurance Code (e.g., Shuttle): ~$1,000 - $3,000 per LOC.
    *   Typical Software: ~$10 - $100 per LOC.
    *   Agentic Coding (AI): ~$0.00002 - $0.002 per LOC.
    *   "Even if we make the process 100x more rigorous, AI-generated high-assurance code will still be cheaper than human-written 'typical' software."
    *   AI enables applying expensive high-assurance processes widely.
*   **Practical Steps for Today**
    *   Use typed languages and modular code with AI agents.
    *   Require agents to write explicit risk analyses and safety cases.
    *   Use separate prompts (and LLM providers) for writing vs. testing code.
    *   Keep AI-generated code small and rely on verified libraries.
    *   "The vision of 'Zero Bugs' is achievable not by inventing new reliability techniques, but by democratizing existing high-assurance methods using the massive cost reduction provided by AI."
Iconography Suggestions:
*   For "Bug-Free Software is Proven": Draw a space shuttle or a simple airplane outline, maybe a Mars rover.
*   For "Process is the Path": A flowchart or gears interlocking.
*   For "Foundations": Books stacked, a blueprint, or a small block of code with mathematical symbols.
*   For "AI: The Economic Game Changer": A calculator or a dollar sign with an AI brain icon nearby; a graph showing drastically falling costs.
*   For "Practical Steps": A checklist, a magnifying glass over code, or two robotic arms (one writing, one testing).
Mood: Optimistic, visionary, logical, empowering.
