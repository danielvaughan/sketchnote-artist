Title Text: Designing with Users in Mind: UCD for Bioinformatics
Featured Speaker: Jennifer Cham (Draw a simple caricature with a thought bubble above her head: "Who is the user?")
Central Metaphor: Building a Bridge (Connecting complex science with intuitive tools)
Visual Hierarchy:
Header (Big Text): User-Centered Design (UCD) is key to making complex scientific tools intuitive and useful.
Sub-Headers (Medium Text):
Challenges in Bioinformatics Design
Details (Small Text):
*   **Diverse Users:** Computational (command line) vs. Bench Biologists (intuitive interfaces).
*   **Complexity vs. Usability:** Balancing massive data with ease of use.
*   **Intangible Success:** No sales, but "scientific discovery" or fewer help tickets.
*   **Developer Bias:** "Systemizing" (logic) vs. "Empathizing" (user feelings).
Iconography Suggestions: Two different user silhouettes (one with code, one with a test tube), a tangled knot, a question mark, a brain with gears.

Sub-Headers (Medium Text):
1. Characterize Users: Personas as Empathy Tools
Details (Small Text):
*   "You are not the user!" - Design based on user needs, not developer assumptions.
*   **Personas:** Fictional profiles (name, motivation, data needs) like "Hannah, a geneticist."
*   **Mapping:** What data do users have? What answers do they need?
Iconography Suggestions: A magnifying glass over a diverse crowd, a mask or face icon for "persona," a map with a start and end point.

Sub-Headers (Medium Text):
2. Design Interactions: Interactive Workshops
Details (Small Text):
*   **Gamestorming:** Use interactive workshops instead of passive meetings.
*   **"Canvas Sort":** Users arrange data cards on a blank template to prioritize essential info and define flow.
*   Reveals what users *actually* need.
Iconography Suggestions: Speech bubbles, puzzle pieces, a hand arranging cards on a board, a lightbulb appearing above a user's head.

Sub-Headers (Medium Text):
3. Test Using Prototypes: Observe, Don't Ask
Details (Small Text):
*   **Paper Prototyping:** Low-fidelity mockups with *real* data (e.g., paper, Balsamiq).
*   **Scenario-Based Testing:** Give specific tasks ("Find 3D structure...") not "Do you like this?"
*   **Silent Observation:** Watch users struggle; design is flawed. Paper avoids aesthetic distractions.
*   "7 out of 8 users failed to find the button."
Iconography Suggestions: A paper airplane, a magnifying glass observing a person at a desk, a red X or a confused face, a simple wireframe.

Sub-Headers (Medium Text):
UCD's Impact & Scalability
Details (Small Text):
*   **Evidence-Based Decisions:** Data resolves disputes (e.g., button placement).
*   **Ethical Obligation:** Publicly funded tools *must* be usable; usability evidence for publishing.
*   **"Guerrilla Testing":** Small projects can test with "2-3 people in the canteen for 20 minutes" – cost-effective, high impact.
Iconography Suggestions: A balance scale, a handshake, a group of people at a table, a stopwatch, a megaphone.

Memorable Quotes:
*   "You are not the user."
*   "7 out of 8 users failed to find the button."
*   "Grab 2 or 3 people in the canteen for 20 minutes."
Iconography Suggestions: Speech bubbles next to the quotes.

Mood: Informative, Empowering, Action-Oriented.
