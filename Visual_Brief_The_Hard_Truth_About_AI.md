Featured Speaker: Maureen (AI Engineer). Visual Suggestion: Draw her with a serious, analytical expression, perhaps wearing glasses, standing next to a "Caution" road sign.
Central Metaphor: "The Rising Flood." Visualize AI as a rising water level. "White Collar" desk jobs are being submerged. The only dry land (safe zones) are the peaks of "Physical Labor" and "Human Connection."

Visual Hierarchy:
Header (Big Text): THE HARD TRUTH: AI IS NOT HYPE
Sub-Headers (Medium Text):
1. The "Judgment" Myth
2. From Chatbot to Agent
3. The "Satisfactory" Trap
4. Safe Havens (The Moat)

Details (Small Text):
*   **The Myth:** Human judgment isn't magic; it's just pattern recognition. LLMs are mastering this.
*   **The Shift:** We are moving from tools we talk to (Chatbots) to autonomous systems that plan and execute workflows (Agentic AI).
*   **The Economics:** Corporations don't want perfection; they want "Good Enough" (Satisfactory) at a fraction of the cost.
*   **Big Tech Strategy:** They are playing an "Infinite Game"—buying land, power, and data centers (Critical Infrastructure), not just building apps.
*   **Don't Upskill, Pivot:** Prompt engineering is a dead end.

Iconography Suggestions:
*   **Pattern Recognition:** A human brain fading into digital circuit patterns.
*   **Agentic AI:** A robot sitting at an office desk with a "Manager" nameplate.
*   **The Trap:** A rubber stamp marked "SATISFACTORY" or "GOOD ENOUGH."
*   **Infrastructure:** Silhouettes of cooling towers and server racks.
*   **Safe Havens:** A wrench (Manual Labor) and a handshake inside a heart (Human Connection).

Mood: Sobering, Realistic, Warning, Industrial.
