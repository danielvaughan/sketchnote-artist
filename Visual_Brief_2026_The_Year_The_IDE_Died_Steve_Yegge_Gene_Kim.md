Title Text: 2026: The Year The IDE Died & The Rise of Vibe Coding
Youtube URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Dtu2bilcFs
Featured Speaker: Steve Yegge & Gene Kim. (Visual Suggestion: Draw Steve Yegge on the left looking slightly cynical/prophetic, and Gene Kim on the right looking enthusiastic/urgent. Between them, place a tombstone labeled "IDE".)
Central Metaphor: The Industrial Revolution of Code. Contrast a lonely, slow Swiss Watchmaker (The Manual Coder) vs. A High-Speed Automated Factory (The AI Orchestrator).

Visual Hierarchy:
Header (Big Text): THE END OF MANUAL CODING
Sub-Headers (Medium Text):
1. The Staff Engineer Curse (The Quartz Crisis)
2. Tool Evolution: Operator vs. Laborer
3. The FAFO Framework (Why Vibe Code?)
4. Future Architecture: Diver vs. Ant Colony

Details (Small Text):
*   **The Curse:** Senior engineers are resisting AI like Swiss watchmakers resisted quartz. Juniors are adapting faster.
*   **The Risk:** Refusing to stop hand-coding leads to obsolescence.
*   **Evolution:** We are moving from AI as a "Power Drill" (human holds the tool) to a "CNC Machine" (human supervises the automation).
*   **FAFO Benefits:**
    *   **F**aster shipping.
    *   **A**mbitious projects (tackling the impossible).
    *   **A**lone (One person = Full team).
    *   **F**un (Addictive workflow).
    *   **O**ptions (More economic shots on goal).
*   **Architecture:** Don't use one giant AI context (The Diver). Use an orchestrator managing swarms of small, specialized agents (The Ant Colony).
*   **Advice:** Push past the 10-20 hour frustration barrier to unlock 100x productivity.

Iconography Suggestions:
*   **The Crisis:** A broken mechanical watch next to a sleek digital watch.
*   **The Tools:** A simple hand drill vs. a complex, large robotic manufacturing arm.
*   **The Architecture:** A deep-sea diver struggling with a heavy tank vs. a swarm of ants building a structure together.
*   **The Future:** A calendar page showing "2026" with a red "X" over a computer monitor.

Mood: Urgent, Revolutionary, Provocative, Futuristic.
